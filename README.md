# React-Responsive-Canvas
A responsive canvas built in React. Canvas has high DPI support. A splash screen, movement tracking and collison detection are included.

This responsive canvas works by scaling by DPR(device pixel ratio) when resizing. Scaling by DPR allows the canvas to fill the entire screen width and height, while removing the blur caused by the pixel differences between CSS and the device.
